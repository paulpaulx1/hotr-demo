        <h2 className={styles.subhead}>Fabbri Chamber Concerts</h2>
        <p>
          Launched in October 1999, <strong>Fabbri Chamber Concerts</strong>{" "}
          presents an annual series of three concerts at the House of the
          Redeemer, offering exciting and creative programs played by the finest
          artists. Past performances have included the world-renowned artists
          Stanley Drucker, clarinetist; Andre Emelianoff, cellist; and Carol
          Wincenc, flutist. Pianist and Artistic Director of the series, Andrew
          Armstrong, praised by the <em>New York Times</em> for playing that
          “danced and glittered deliciously,” frequently joins the performances.
        </p>

        <p>
          Presented in an ideal chamber music setting, the concerts take place
          in the elegant wood-paneled Italian Renaissance library of the House
          of the Redeemer. This beautiful space with its warm acoustics, the
          brief introductory remarks offered for each piece, and the opportunity
          to meet the artists at a reception following the concert allow
          audiences to share a unique and intimate musical salon experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The House has been noted by the <em>New York Times</em> as embodying
          “the artisanship of a bygone era.” The House and its library were
          first opened with a private recital by violinist Fritz Kreisler in
          1917. Concerts were often performed in the library while Mrs. Fabbri
          was in residence. The Fabbri Chamber Concerts continues the musical
          tradition begun by the Fabbri family.
